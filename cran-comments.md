 * THIS IS A VERSION UPDATE WITH BUG FIXES *
 -previous version: 0.1.0
 -current version 0.1.1
 Reason for new version: bug due to 'transparent' no longer a valid color option for
 ggplot2::scale_fill_gradient. This introduced an error in plotFoldEnrichment():
 
 Quitting from lines 379-381 (diffenrich_vignette.Rmd)
    Error: processing vignette 'diffenrich_vignette.Rmd' failed with diagnostics:
    need at least two non-NA values to interpolate
    --- failed re-building 'diffenrich_vignette.Rmd'
    
  SUMMARY: processing the following file failed:
  'diffenrich_vignette.Rmd'
    
  Error: Vignette re-building failed.
  Execution halted
  
  I fixed this by changing the 'transparent' color to 'white'. This seems to have
  resolved the issue. diffEnrich is now passing all checks. The 'new maintainer'
  NOTE is because I updated my email address.
