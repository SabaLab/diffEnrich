 Revier comments:
 Tanks, please omit the redundant "The goal of diffEnrich is to". Rather,
is there some reference about the method you can add in the Description
field in the form Authors (year) <doi:.....>?

OLD:"The goal of diffEnrich is to compare functional enrichment between two experimentally-derived groups of genes or proteins."

UPDATED: "Compare functional enrichment between two experimentally-derived groups of genes or proteins (Peterson, DR., et al.(2018)) <doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0198139>."
